    <h1>align-content</h1>
    <p>
        The <strong>align-content</strong> property sets the distribution of space between and around content items
        along a flexbox's cross-axis or a grid's block axis.
        <br> <br>
        The <strong>align-content</strong> property specifies how flex lines are distributed along the cross axis in
        a flexbox
        container.
        <br> <br>
        <b>Tip: </b>Use the justify-content property to align the items on the main axis (horizontally).
        <br> <br>
        <strong>Note: </strong>The align-content property can also be used on a grid container to align grid items in
        the block direction. <br>For pages in English, block direction is downward and inline direction is left to
        right.
