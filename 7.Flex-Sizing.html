    <h1><u>Flex-sizing</u></h1>
    <p>The <span class="title">Flex-Sizing</span> makes it possible to create flexible layouts that
        fully adapt to the screen.</p>
    <p>If you set up everything correctly you won't have to rely on media queries to support different viewports,
        layouts, and orientations. </p>
    <p>This property determines the resizing behavior of flex children across viewport sizes. They can shrink,
        grow, or remain static.</p>

    <h2><u>Filling up Free Space</u></h2>
    <p>One of the most challenging aspects of writing CSS is figuring out how to allocate the free space that remains
        on the screen after the page has been populated with content.</p>
    <p> At some viewport sizes, you'll often find there's too much remaining space and you want to fill it with
        something. </p>

    <p> At other viewport sizes, you might find there's not enough space, and the layout breaks in one way or another.
    </p>

    <h2><u>flex-basis</u></h2>
    <p>It specifies the <b>initial length</b> of a flexible item.</p>
    <p>It specifies how flex items should behave when there's <i>exactly as much space as needed</i>.</p>
    <p>The default value of flex-basis is <b>auto</b>, which means that the size of the flex items is calculated using
        either the width or height of the element (depending on if itâ€™s a row-based or column-based layout). </p>
    <p> when the value of flex-basis is something other than auto, it overrides the value of width (or height in case of
        vertical layouts). </p>

    <h2><u>flex-grow</u></h2>
    <p>It specifies how much the item will <b>grow</b> relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same
        container.</p>
    <p> how flex items should behave when there's a <i>surplus of free space</i> (how they should grow).</p>
    <p>defines how any extra space in-between flex items should be allocated on the screen.</p>
    <p> flex-grow doesn't divide up the entire flex container, only the space that remains after the browser renders all
        flex items. <br>If there's no surplus of space, flex-grow has no effect.</p>
